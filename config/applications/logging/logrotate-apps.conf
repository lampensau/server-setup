# Application log rotation configuration
# This file is intentionally minimal to avoid logrotate validation issues
# Add specific application log rotations as needed when applications are installed

# Example configuration for future use:
# /var/log/myapp/*.log {
#     daily
#     rotate 30
#     compress
#     delaycompress
#     missingok
#     notifempty
#     create 0640 root adm
#     postrotate
#         systemctl reload myapp || true
#     endscript
# }
